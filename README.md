# Instagram Likes Analysis

## Project Overview
This project analyze Instagram likes across different content categories to uncover engagement trends. On this repository there is an uploaded **Jupyter Notebook file** (`omedina_instagram_post_likes.ipynb`) with all the analysis. 

Using Python (`pandas`, `seaborn`, `matplotlib`), we simulated, cleaned, visualized, and statistically analyzed the data to gain insights into content performance.

## Process & Challenges

### Importing Required Libraries
```python
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
import random
import seaborn as sns
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
```

### Data Generation
- Created a dataset with **500 Instagram posts**, each assigned a category and a random number of likes.
```python
# Define categories
categories = ['Food', 'Travel', 'Fashion', 'Fitness', 'Music', 'Culture', 'Family', 'Health']

# Number of records
n = 500

# Generate random data
data = {
    'Date': pd.date_range(start='2023-01-01', periods=n),
    'Category': [random.choice(categories) for _ in range(n)],
    'Likes': np.random.randint(0, 10000, size=n)
}
```

### Data Cleaning and Formatting

- Handled missing and duplicate values using `.dropna()` and `.drop_duplicates()`.
- Converted `Date` to `datetime` format and ensured `Likes` were integers, ensuring accuracy.
  
```python
# Remove null values
df = df.dropna()

# Remove duplicates rows
df = df.drop_duplicates()

# Convert 'Date' column to datetime format
df['Date'] = pd.to_datetime(df['Date'])

# Convert 'Likes' column to integer
df['Likes'] = df['Likes'].astype(int)
```
  
### Data Visualization
- ðŸ“Š **Histogram of Likes** revealed the overall engagement distribution across posts.
- ðŸ“Œ **Boxplot of Likes per Category** highlighted which content types received more likes.
- Choosing the best visualization was a challenge, but testing different graphs helped identify the most informative ones.

```python
# Create histogram of Likes
sns.histplot(df['Likes'])
plt.title('Distribution of Likes')
plt.xlabel('Likes')
plt.ylabel('Frequency')

# Show the histogram
plt.show()

# Create boxplot with 'Category' as x-axis and 'Likes' as y-axis
sns.boxplot(x=df['Category'], y=df['Likes'])
plt.title('Likes Distribution per Category')
plt.xticks(rotation=45)  # Rotate category labels for readability

# Show the boxplot
plt.show()

# Calculate overall mean of 'Likes'
mean_likes = df['Likes'].mean()
print(f"\nOverall Mean of Likes: {mean_likes:.2f}")

# Calculate mean 'Likes' per 'Category'
category_mean_likes = df.groupby('Category')['Likes'].mean().round(2)
print("\nMean Likes per Category:")
print(category_mean_likes)
```

### Statistical Analysis & Insights
- The **average number of likes per post** was **~5000**.
- **Food, Fashion, and Fitness** categories received the highest engagement, indicating users prefer these content types.
- **Travel and Culture** posts had lower engagement, suggesting they might require better captions, hashtags, or posting times to improve reach.
