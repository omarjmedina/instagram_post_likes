# Instagram Likes Analysis

## Project Overview
This project analyze Instagram likes across different content categories to uncover engagement trends. On this repository there is an uploaded **Jupyter Notebook file** (`omedina_instagram_post_likes.ipynb`) with all the analysis. 

Using Python (`pandas`, `seaborn`, `matplotlib`), we simulated, cleaned, visualized, and statistically analyzed the data to gain insights into content performance.

## Process & Challenges

### Data Generation & Cleaning
- Created a dataset with **500 Instagram posts**, each assigned a category and a random number of likes.
- Handled missing and duplicate values using `.dropna()` and `.drop_duplicates()`.
- Converted `Date` to `datetime` format and ensured `Likes` were integers, ensuring accuracy.

### Data Visualization
- ðŸ“Š **Histogram of Likes** revealed the overall engagement distribution across posts.
- ðŸ“Œ **Boxplot of Likes per Category** highlighted which content types received more likes.
- Choosing the best visualization was a challenge, but testing different graphs helped identify the most informative ones.

### Statistical Analysis & Insights
- The **average number of likes per post** was **~5000**.
- **Food, Fashion, and Fitness** categories received the highest engagement, indicating users prefer these content types.
- **Travel and Culture** posts had lower engagement, suggesting they might require better captions, hashtags, or posting times to improve reach.
