Project Overview
This project analyzed Instagram likes across different content categories to uncover engagement trends. Using Python (pandas, seaborn, matplotlib), we simulated, cleaned, visualized, and statistically analyzed the data to gain insights into content performance.

Process & Challenges
Data Generation & Cleaning

Created a dataset with 500 Instagram posts, each assigned a category and a random number of likes.
Handled missing and duplicate values using .dropna() and .drop_duplicates().
Converted Date to datetime format and ensured Likes were integers, ensuring accuracy.
Data Visualization

Histogram of Likes revealed the overall engagement distribution across posts.
Boxplot of Likes per Category highlighted which content types received more likes.
Choosing the best visualization was a challenge, but testing different graphs helped identify the most informative ones.
Statistical Analysis & Insights

The average number of likes per post was ~4900.
Health, Culture, and Fashion categories received the highest engagement, indicating users prefer these content types.
Travel and Family posts had lower engagement, suggesting they might require better captions, hashtags, or posting times to improve reach.
